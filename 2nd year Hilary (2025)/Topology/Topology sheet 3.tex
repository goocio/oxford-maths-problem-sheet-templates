\begin{questions}

\question%1
Let $\mathrm d$ be one of the metrics $\mathrm{d}_{1}$, $\mathrm{d}_{2}$, $\mathrm{d}_{\infty}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Let $K$ be a non-empty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and let $F$ be a non-empty closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We define \[
	\operatorname{dist}(K, F)=\inf \{\mathrm{d}(x, y): x \in K, y \in F\}
\] Prove that there exists $a \in K$ and $b \in F$ such that $\mathrm{d}(a, b)=\operatorname{dist}(K, F)$.



\question%2
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and let $C=X \cup\{\infty\}$ where $\infty$ denotes some extra point not in $X$. Let $\mathcal{T}'$ denote the union of $\mathcal{T}$ with all subsets of $C$ of the form $V \cup\{\infty\}$ where $V \subseteq X$ and $X \setminus V$ is compact and closed in $X$.
\begin{parts}
\part%2a
Prove that $(C, \mathcal{T}')$ is a compact topological space containing $(X, \mathcal{T})$ as a subspace. This is called the \emph{one-point} (or the \emph{Alexandrov}) \emph{compactification} of $X$.

\part%2b
Prove that the one-point compactification of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere.
\end{parts}



\question%3
Let $l^{\infty}$ be the space of bounded sequences of real numbers, endowed with the norm $\|\mathbf{x}\|_{\infty}=\sup _{n \in \mathbb{N}}|x_{n}|$, where $\mathbf{x}=(x_{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$. Prove that the closed unit ball of $l^{\infty}$, $B'(\mathbf{0}, 1)=\left\{\mathbf{x} \in l^{\infty}: \|\mathbf{x}\|_{\infty} \leq 1\right\}$, is not compact. (Thus, $B'(\mathbf{0}, 1)$ is a closed bounded subset in a complete normed vector space which is not compact.) [\emph{Hint: The equivalence between compactness and sequential compactness in the setting of metric spaces may be assumed.}]



% NOTE: this question had \bigcap K_n not \bigcup K_n, which is nonsense (since then we'd need each K_n=\mathbb R^n so trivially they *all* have non-empty interior) so I've assumed it was a mistake
\question%4
Let $O_n$ be a sequence of open dense subsets of $\mathbb R^n$. Show that \[
  \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty O_n
\] is non-empty. Deduce that if \[
  \mathbb R^n=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty K_n
\] where $K_n$ are closed, then some $K_n$ has non-empty interior.



\question%5
Let $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space and let $f: X \to X$ be such that \[
	d(f(x), f(y))=d(x, y) \text{ for all } x, y \in X
\] Show that $f$ is surjective. Is this true if $X$ is not assumed to be compact?



\question%6
Let $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space and let $f: X \to X$ be such that \[
	d(f(x), f(y))<d(x, y) \text{ for all } x \neq y
\] Show that $f$ has a unique fixed point. Is this true if $X$ is not assumed to be compact?



\question%7
Recall that the integer part (or integral part) of a real number $x$ is the unique integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n \leq x<n+1$. We denote it by $I(x)$. On $\mathbb{R}$ we define the relation $x \mathcal{R} y \iff I(x)=I(y)$.
\begin{parts}
\part%7a
Prove that $\mathcal{R}$ is an equivalence relation.

\part%7b
Let $p: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} / \mathcal{R}$ be the quotient map, let $\mathbb{R} / \mathcal{R}$ be endowed with the quotient topology, and let $U$ be an open set in $\mathbb{R} / \mathcal{R}$. Prove that if $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is such that $p(n) \in U$ then $p(n-1) \in U$.

\part%7c
Deduce that the open sets in $\mathbb{R} / \mathcal{R}$ are $\emptyset$, $\mathbb{R} / \mathcal{R}$ and the image sets $p(-\infty, n]$, where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

\part%7d
Consider the map $I: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{Z}$, $x \mapsto I(x)$.
\begin{subparts}
\subpart%7di
Is the map $I$ continuous (when $\mathbb{Z}$ is endowed with the subspace topology)?

\subpart%7dii
Prove that $I$ defines a bijection $\widetilde{I}: \mathbb{R} / \mathcal{R} \to \mathbb{Z}$. What is the topology on $\mathbb{Z}$ making $\widetilde{I}$ a homeomorphism?
\end{subparts}
\end{parts}



\question%8
\begin{parts}
\part%8a
Let $X$ be a topological space and $A$ a subset of $X$. On $X \times\{0,1\}$ define the partition composed of the pairs $\{(a, 0),(a, 1)\}$ for $a \in A$, and of the singletons $\{(x, i)\}$ if $x \in X \setminus A$ and $i \in\{0,1\}$. Let $\mathcal{R}$ be the equivalence relation defined by this partition, let $Y$ be the quotient space $[X \times\{0,1\}] / \mathcal{R}$ and let $p: X \times\{0,1\} \to Y$ be the quotient map.
\begin{subparts}
\subpart%8ai
Prove that there exists a continuous map $f: Y \to X$ such that $f \circ p(x, i)=x$ for every $x \in X$ and $i \in\{0,1\}$.

\subpart%8aii
Prove that $Y$ is Hausdorff if and only if $X$ is Hausdorff and $A$ is a closed subset of $X$.
\end{subparts}

\part%8b
Consider the above construction for $X=[0,1]$ and $A$ an arbitrary subset of $[0,1]$. Prove that $Y$ is compact. Prove that $K=p(X \times\{0\})$ and $L=p(X \times\{1\})$ are compact, and that $K \cap L$ is homeomorphic to $A$. (\emph{We have thus shown that the intersection of two compact subsets in a space that is not Hausdorff may be non-compact and not closed.})
\end{parts}



\question%9
The goal of this exercise is to show there exists an embedding of the real projective plane $\mathbb{R} P^{2}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$.\\ Let $\mathbb{S}^{2}$ denote the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ given by $\mathbb{S}^{2}=\{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^{3}: x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1\}$, and let $f: \mathbb{S}^{2} \to \mathbb{R}^{4}$ be defined by $f(x, y, z)=(x^{2}-y^{2}, x y, y z, z x)$. Prove that
\begin{parts}
\part%9a
$f$ determines a continuous map $\tilde{f}: \mathbb{R} P^{2} \to \mathbb{R}^{4}$ where $\mathbb{R} P^{2}$ is the real projective plane;

\part%9b
$\tilde{f}$ is a homeomorphism onto a topological subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{4}$. [\emph{Hint: when proving that $\tilde{f}$ is injective you need to show that \[
	(x_{1}^{2}-y_{1}^{2}, x_{1} y_{1}, y_{1} z_{1}, z_{1} x_{1})=(x_{2}^{2}-y_{2}^{2}, x_{2} y_{2}, y_{2} z_{2}, z_{2} x_{2})
	\implies(x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2})= \pm(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1})
\] for points $(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2})$ in $\mathbb{S}^{2}$. You might try considering the cases $x_{1} \neq 0$ and $x_{1}=0$.}]

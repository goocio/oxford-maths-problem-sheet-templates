\begin{questions}

\question%1
Let $A_{\infty}$ denote the even permutations of $\mathbb{N}$ which fix all but finitely many elements: that is $A_{\infty}$ is the union \[
	A_{\infty}=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_{n}
\] where $A_{n} \subset A_{n+1}$ in the natural way. Show that $A_{\infty}$ is an infinite simple group.



\question%2
Let $G$ be a group and $[G, G]$ its commutator subgroup (derived subgroup).
\begin{parts}
\part%2a
Show that if $H \nsg G$ and $G / H$ is Abelian then $[G, G] \leqslant H$.

\part%2b
Conversely, show that if $[G, G] \leqslant H \leqslant G$ then $H \nsg G$ and $G / H$ is Abelian.
\end{parts}



\question%3
A sequence \[
	\ldots \xrightarrow{\phi_{i-2}} G_{i-1} \xrightarrow{\phi_{i-1}} G_{i} \xrightarrow{\phi_{i}} \ldots
\] of groups and homomorphisms is called exact at $G_{i}$ if \[
	\ker \phi_{i}=\operatorname{im} \phi_{i-1}
\] Show that if $N \nsg G$ then \[
	1 \to N \to G \to G / N \to 1
\] is exact at $N$, $G$ and $G / N$, where the middle two maps are inclusion and the canonical quotient map.



\question%4
Verify Sylow's Theorems for the following groups: \[
	S_{3},\ D_{12},\ A_{4},\ S_{4} .
\]



\question%5
Let $P$ be a non-trivial group of order $p^{m}$ where $p$ is prime (so $P$ is a `$p$-group').
\begin{parts}
\part%5a
By considering the conjugation action of $P$ on itself prove that the centre \[
	Z(P)=\{z \in P: z x=x z \text { for all } x \in P\}
\] is nontrivial.

\part%5b
Deduce, using induction on $m$, that $P$ is solvable. What can you say if $m=2$?
\end{parts}



\question%6
Show that every group of order 350 is solvable.



\question%7
Let $G$ be a group of order 30.
\begin{parts}
\part%7a
Show that either: (1) there is a normal subgroup $N$ of order 5 and a subgroup $H$ of order 3, or (2) there is a normal subgroup $N$ of order 3 and a subgroup $H$ of order 5. Deduce that $G$ has a normal subgroup $K$ isomorphic to $C_{15}$.

\part%7b
Let $y$ be a generator of $K$ and let $x$ be an order 2 element. Show that \[
	G=\{x^i y^j: 0 \leqslant i \leqslant 1,\ 0 \leqslant j \leqslant 14\}
\]

\part%7c
Let $\psi \in \operatorname{Aut}(K)$ satisfy $\psi^{2}=i d_{K}$. Show that $\psi: y \mapsto y^i$ where $i \in\{1,4,11,14\}$.

\part%7d
Deduce that there are exactly four groups of order 30, up to isomorphism.
\end{parts}



\question%8
